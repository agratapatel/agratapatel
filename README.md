Hey I'm Agrata

I'm a product designer and maker living in Raipur, India. Currently, I'm designing commerce tools at Atlassian. Previously I interned at Samsung Design and did HCI undergrad from IIT Guwahati. Let's get to know each other.

I once kinda made a whole website which will let graduating seniors pass their stuff to  juniors and that was called Signing off. Thought it was pretty cool initiative! [See it here &rarr;](https://www.signingoff.webflow.io)
